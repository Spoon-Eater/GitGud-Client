Hello and thanks for having downloaded GitGud!
To run the game correctly you need to have the Steam client launched on your computer and be logged in,
then you can click on the plus icon in the bottom left corner and finally click on "add non steam game" and choose either Win64_client.x86_64.exe or Linux64_client.x86_64 de pending on your hardware.
You should now be good to go and just hit play on steam!
