Hello, 
For this very first GitGud update i added not a lot of stuff but it's quite nice.

 - Added ingame chat with "T" wich stand for Trashtalk
 - Replaced the old collisions for more accurate and precise one following the animations so no more leaning collisions problem
 - fixed the sniper unscope animation not going on the last frame
 - added some blending fade to the fps animations to make the transitions between them smoother and less clunky

And for the upcoming new update of the next week im gonna add the loadout system to choose your guns and of course
i will also create 2 new secondary weapons.
Hope im gonna see you there !
